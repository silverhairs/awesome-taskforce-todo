## üßê About <a name = "about"></a>

This is my participation to the Awesomity Lab Mobille Task Force Challenge that was about building a not realy basic TODO app.

## üèÅ Getting Started <a name = "getting_started"></a>

These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes.

### Prerequisites

- [Flutter](https://flutter.dev)
- [Dart](https://dart.dev/) (version 2.10.5 or upper)
- An IDE/Text Editor (Android Studio, VS Code or IntelliJ IDEA)
- An Android device (physical or emulator)

**PS: To run the app on an iOS simulator, you need XCode**

After all the prerequisites are met, follow the steps below: <br/>
Make sure the emulator is already running and if you are using a physical device, make sure it is plugged and and USB debugging is activated. Run the command bellow to see if flutter has detected your device:

```
$ flutter devices
```

Then run the commands below in the written order to clone, install and run the app.

```
$ git clone silverhairs/awesome-taskforce-todo.git
$ cd awesome-taskforce-todo/
$ flutter run
```

### Installing

A step by step series of examples that tell you how to get a development env running.

Say what the step will be

```
Give the example
```

And repeat

```
until finished
```

End with an example of getting some data out of the system or using it for a little demo.

## üîß Running the tests <a name = "tests"></a>

Explain how to run the automated tests for this system.

### Break down into end to end tests

Explain what these tests test and why

```
Give an example
