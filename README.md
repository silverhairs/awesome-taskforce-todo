## üßê About <a name = "about"></a>

This is my contribution to the Awesomity Lab Mobille Task Force Challenge that was about building a not realy basic TODO app.

## üèÅ Getting Started <a name = "getting_started"></a>

These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes.

### Prerequisites

- [Flutter](https://flutter.dev)
- [Dart](https://dart.dev/) (version 2.10.5 or upper)
- An IDE/Text Editor (Android Studio, VS Code or IntelliJ IDEA)
- An Android device (physical or emulator)

Make sure your emulator/simulator is up and running and if you are are using a physical device instead, make sure it is plugged and USB debugging is activated. Run the command bellow to see if flutter has detected your device:

```
$ flutter devices
```

### Installing

**PS: To run the app on an iOS simulator, you need XCode**

After all the prerequisites are met, follow the steps below in the written order to clone, install and run the app in your device.

```
$ git clone silverhairs/awesome-taskforce-todo.git
$ cd awesome-taskforce-todo/
$ flutter run
```

## üéà Usage <a name="usage"></a>

## ü•≤ Weird behaviours & undone work <a name = "behaviours"></a>

I joined the challenge pretty late so there are a bunch of stuff that I didn't really have time to do.

- Tests: There is zero tests written (I am pretty new in writing flutter tests so I usually postpone it until It's not done)
- Redux: I am not familiar with Redux and didn't have enough time to learn it so I used [riverpod](https://pub.dev/packages/riverpod) instead.
- Firebase: Well I started but didn't finish once again because of the time.
- Commenting.
- Splash screen on iOS: I don't own a Mac so I could not implement this because I don't have access to XCode.
